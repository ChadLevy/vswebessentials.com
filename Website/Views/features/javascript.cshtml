        <h3>JSHint</h3>

        <p>
            JSHint is a really good way of making sure your JavaScript follows certain coding 
            guidelines and best practices. The default settings are very relaxed, but you can 
            turn on more rules through the new options dialog.
        </p>

        <p>
            The error window updates as you type, so you don’t have to right-click the .js file to kick off JSHint. It happens as you write.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each indiviual JavaScript file can override the global settings by using the official 
            JSHint comment format descripted in the <a href="http://www.jshint.com/docs/">JSHint documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In version 1.8 you can also enable JSHint to run on build.

        <h3>Regions</h3>

        <p>
            Some people hate them, other people loves them. This is a feature that was in the 
            original Web Essentials 2010 an by popular request now made it in the 2012 version.

        <h3>Outlining/code folding</h3>

        <p>
            Only functions provide outlining support by Visual Studio 2012. Web Essentials adds 
            outlining supports to any scope including multiline arrays.

        <h3>Minification</h3>

        <p>
            Right-click any JS file in Solution Explorer to produce a *.min.js file. Whenever the source .js file is changed, the .min.js file is updated accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>Source Maps</h3>

        <p>
            When minifying, Source Map (.js.maps) files are automatically generated by enabling it in Tools -> Options.

        <h3>JSDoc comments</h3>

        <p>
            Get full Intellisense and tooltips based on the  
            <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html">JsDoc comment</a> format that a lot of libraries use.

        <h3>Auto-complete braces</h3>

        <p>
            When an opening curly brace, square bracket or parenthesis is typed, the closing ditto 
            is inserted to the right of the cursor. Type-through is supported to not mess with muscle memory.
        </p>

        <h3>Smarter indent</h3>

        <p>
            Hitting Enter when the cursor is between an opening and closing curly brace now places the 
            cursor correctly on the line below with the correct indentation.
